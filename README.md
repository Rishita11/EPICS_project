# INTRODUCTION:

Depression could be a common worldwide disease with doubtless severe implications.
The continuous feeling of disappointment or loss of interest that characterizes depression will
result in a variety of behavioral and physical symptoms. These could result in lack of sleep,
appetite, energy state, concentration, daily behavior or shallowness. Depression also can be
related to depressive and suicidal thoughts.

Early detection of depressive symptoms can be an important step for evaluation and
prevention of this disease. An expanding knowledge set related to depression, as well as
advances in machine learning, may lead to the development of smart systems to detect
depression symptoms in written communication. Major Depression, Persistent Depressive
Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), Psychotic Depression,
Peripartum (Postpartum) Depression, Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD), and
'Situational' Depression are some of the several types of depression. Few of them could not be
detected at a very early stage.

There are currently no pharmacological treatment diagnostic biomarkers available to
determine the level and type of depression. Our machine learning model has been
programmed to retrieve data from the wristband and the Montgomeryâ€“Sberg Depression
Rating Scale (MADRS) test, both of which will be available on our website. As a result, it
will be easier to forecast the severity of depression.
